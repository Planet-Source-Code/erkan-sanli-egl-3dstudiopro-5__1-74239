### Description

Added Shadow Matrix. Transparency bugs have been fixed in this version. Code optimization was achieved greatly. Texturing of the material gathered in a single module. 3d model served as the fastest ever. DirectX or OpenGL is not used. In addition, the filter feature added with bilinear. Thus a more realistic view was obtained. 2nd addition, useful Color Selector dialog box. This upload the final project of 3D viewer. Thank you to my friends in the PSC.(Zip:980 kb)
